Hello! I'm Ruoshen Mo, a 1st-year PhD student at UCR, co-advised by [Prof. Zhaowei Tan](https://cs.ucr.edu/~ztan/) and [Prof. Hang Qiu](https://hangqiu.github.io/). Previsouly, I was an undergraduate in the College of Computer Science in Sichuan University, under supervision of [Prof. Yanbing Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qpLuOggAAAAJ).

I'm interested in various aspects of systems, including computer networks, computer security, and related fields. Currently, I'm focused on **the wireless communication system in V2X**.
