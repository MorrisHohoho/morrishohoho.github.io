{{<project_abstract>}}
SEE-V2X is a real-world C-V2X dataset, using commercial off-the-shelf standard compliant C-V2X radios. Emulating the traffic patterns of popular C-V2X applications, we investigate the gap between the demand and reality. Beyond throughput and latency, C-V2X contains cross-layer details, offers insight into the resource scheduling and allocation mechanism in various situations, and reveals the impact of nuanced configuration.

{{<project_main "SEE-V2X Overview">}}
SEE-V2X dataset has 4 scenes in total: Indoor_AllCombos, Indoor_Selective,
Outdoor_ParkingLot, and Outdoor_Openroad. Each scenario has application layer network trace generated by the C-V2X radio, C-V2X MAC layer trace and Sidelink control information captured by USRP B210.
Additionally, for the outdoor_openroad scenarios, we provide GNSS coordinates for each UE. The detailed dataset description of each scene is given in the official github repository.

{{<project_main "Example Analysis">}}
We present preliminary analysis results on the
collected traces, illustrating how SEE-V2X can offer a glimpse
into the real-world C-V2X traffic and more importantly its
implications on emerging futuristic C-V2X applications.

1. **Throughput**: We calculate the throughput of the C-V2X, The maxmimum throughput we got from our dataset is 1.5Mbps, which is far below the throughput requirement of cooperative driving applications.

2. **Outdoor Parking Lot**: We analyze the throughput of the C-V2X in the outdoor parking lot scenario. The throughput is highly realted to the distance between the vehicles.

3. **Channel Occupy**: The transmitting timming matters. We analyze the channe utilization when the packet transmission is not synchronized with the SPS scheudling resources. As the figure shows, extra latency is introduced.
